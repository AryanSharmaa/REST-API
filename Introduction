REST API
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. Created by scientist Roy Fielding.
It is a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web Services.

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST APIs are those APIs which follow the guidelines set by the REST architecture. They follow a client-server model where one software program sends a request and the other responds with some data. REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to send requests & receive responses.
