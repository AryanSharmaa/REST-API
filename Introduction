 REST API
 REST stands for Representational State Transfer. Created by scientist Roy Fielding.
It is a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web Services.

 A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.
