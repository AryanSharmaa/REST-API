We saw how to make REST API calls using the browser. But, what was the purpose of having an API? It was for applications to communicate with each other, right? Letâ€™s now see how to do that programmatically.


Use curl on your command line to make a REST API call to (https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=san). This fetches location information for locations matching the query parameter san.

JAVA PROGRAM :)

import java.io.IOException;

import java.io.InputStreamReader;

import java.net.HttpURLConnection;

import java.net.MalformedURLException;

import java.net.URL;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws MalformedURLException, IOException {

		// create url

		URL url = new URL("https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=san");

		// Send Get request and fetch data

		HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

		conn.setRequestMethod("GET");

		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(

			(conn.getInputStream())));


		// Read data line-by-line from buffer & print it out

		String output;

		while ((output = br.readLine()) != null) {

			System.out.println(output);

		}


		conn.disconnect();

	}

}

Hope you'll enjoy this!!.
